So pretty this is what I did:
    -Website meets accessibility standards:
        WHEN I view the source code
        THEN I find semantic HTML elements
        WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
        THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
        WHEN I view the image elements
        THEN I find accessible alt attributes
        WHEN I view the heading attributes
        THEN they fall in sequential order
        WHEN I view the title element
        THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
    -Consolidated CSS selectors and properties and organized to follow semantic structure.
    -All funtional links
    -CSS commenting for all changes
    -Application loads with no errors
    -Link to deployed application: https://vgines73.github.io/HW1_refactor/

    Just a heads up:
        I had a lot of trouble with pushing it into my repo so I don't have a ton of commits.
